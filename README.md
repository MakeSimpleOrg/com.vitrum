# Vitrum

App for Vitrum switches.

If you are using Homey version less than 1.5.6: after adding any Vitrum device, you must set all association groups to 1.1 manually.

Support only EU wireless switches (1, 2, 3, 4, 6). But you can send me productTypeId and productId, if you want to add another devices.
