# Vitrum

App for Vitrum switches.

If you are using Homey version less than 1.5.6: after adding any Vitrum device, you must set all association groups to 1.1 manually.

Support all EU wireless dimmers (I, II, III, IV, VI), EU wireless On-Off III, and BS wireless On-Off (I, II). But you can send me productTypeId and productId, if you want to add another devices.
